										<p><br>Rating products and services is becoming the norm across society. Whether it be an Uber driver, product or website many companies allow customers to rate their experience. One app <em>(Peeple)</em> has even gone as far as to allow users to rate everyday interactions with their peers. 
                                        <br><br>However, <b>are any of these ratings actually predictive of service/product success?</b>
                                       In our project, we have decided to take the medium of film to compare whether ratings actually correlate to a film’s revenue success.

									<h2>Starting Point</h2>
									<p>Once we knew what we wanted to find out, we begun looking for our data. Upon finding the perfect dataset for our analysis, we embarked on our project with the data and tools outlined below.  </p>
								</header>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon fa-film"></span>
										<strong>45,000</strong> Movies
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa-star-half"></span>
										<strong>26,000,000</strong> Ratings
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon fa-video"></span>
										<strong>18</strong> Genres
									</li>
									<li class="style4">
										<span class="icon fa-user"></span>
										<strong>5</strong> Minds
									</li>
									
								</ul>
								<p> By splitting the research project into different stages and assigning different roles to members in the team, we were able to work efficiently whilst utilising our individual strengths. 
								Through considering the various different factors that might affect revenue other than ratings (gender of cast, genre, budget) we were able to gain a holistic view of the data available to us.
